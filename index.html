      <img src="images/hist.jpg" alt="" >
<p>The earliest recorded history of Manila, the capital of the Philippines, dates back to the year 900 AD as recorded in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. By the thirteenth century, the city consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter near the mouth of the Pasig River, the river that bisects the city into north and south.

   Manila became the seat of the colonial government of Spain when it gained sovereignty over the Philippine Islands in 1565. The seat of the Spanish government was situated within the fortified walls of Old Manila (now referred to as Intramuros meaning within the walls). The walls were constructed to keep out invading Chinese pirates and protect the city from native uprisings. Several communities eventually grew outside the walls of Manila. The city became the center of trade between Manila and Acapulco, which lasted for three centuries and brought the goods from the Americas to Southeast Asia and vice versa.</p>

            The diverse manufacturing activities of Manila include textile production, publishing and printing, food and tobacco processing, and chemical processing. Manila also produces lumber and wood items, rope and cordage, soap, and other goods. Factories generally are small and are located mostly in the congested districts of Tondo (which also has the railroad and truck terminals), Binondo, and Santa Cruz. Heavy industries are located in the districts of Paco, Pandacan, and Santa Ana.

            Manila is the centre of trade and finance in the Philippines. Trade flourishes within the metropolitan area and between the city and the provinces and other countries. Most of the Philippines’ imports and exports pass through the port of Manila. Financial institutions headquartered in Manila include such establishments as the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Philippine National Bank, the Philippine Veterans Bank, the Government Service Insurance System, the Social Security System, and many private commercial and developmental banks. Private insurance companies and the Philippine Stock Exchange also contribute to the mobilization of savings for investment.

            Within the area of Metropolitan Manila, public transportation is provided principally by buses, jeepneys (small buses built on the chassis of jeeps), and taxis. Traffic congestion is serious, especially at the bridges during the morning and evening rush hours. Adjacent towns serve as dormitory suburbs, and many people commute to the city, adding to the traffic problem. Authorities attempted to address this issue with a “number coding” scheme that restricted access to metro Manila roads at peak times based on the last digit of a driver’s license plate. Bus services operate routes to northern and southern Luzon.

            Railroad services operated by the Philippine National Railways also connect the city with northern and southeastern Luzon. An elevated rail line, linking Caloocan City and the city of Baclaran (to the south of Pasay City), was completed in 1984. It was the first phase of a transit system, called the Light Rail Transit, that by the early 21st century had lines extending throughout much of the metropolitan area.
            
            Interisland and international transportation is provided by domestic and foreign airlines and by shipping. Manila South Harbor, with its enclosed customhouse, warehouses, and sheds, is sheltered by a low breakwater. There are no railway lines within the port area, and cargo is transported from the piers by trucks or barges. The piers and warehouses of Manila North Harbor are busy with heavy traffic from all ports in the Philippines. In the 1980s additional port facilities for international shipping were built, partially on reclaimed land, in the area between the two harbours.

            Potable water comes from a supply network managed by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. Satisfactory sanitation conditions are maintained by constant surveillance of markets, restaurants, movie theatres, recreation halls, and slaughterhouses. Insecticides are sprayed regularly on open sewers, uncollected garbage, and standing water; garbage is collected by a fleet of trucks that operate night and day. Moreover, workers maintain cleanliness in the metropolitan area and are also responsible for the beautification of the city as directed by the governor of Metropolitan Manila.
